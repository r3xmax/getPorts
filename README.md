## Introduction
The `getPorts` tool is a Python script inspired by a Bash function originally created by S4vitar. It automates and simplifies both installation and usage by providing a user-friendly Bash installation script. `getPorts` is a useful utility for **extracting port information** from network scan results in Nmap's grepable format (`-oG`).
